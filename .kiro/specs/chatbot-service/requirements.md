# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chatbot Service is a comprehensive multi-tenant API service designed to handle conversational interactions across multiple channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Signal, and Web). The service provides intelligent message routing, natural language processing, and integration with external services including LLM providers, workflow management, and assessment systems. Built with TypeScript, Node.js/Express, TypeORM, and MySQL, the service emphasizes modularity, dependency injection, and extensibility while supporting multiple tenants with isolated data schemas.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy a multi-tenant chatbot service, so that multiple organizations can use the same service instance with isolated data and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts up THEN the system SHALL load tenant-specific settings from an external service and populate them in an in-memory settings cache
2. WHEN a tenant makes a request THEN the system SHALL use tenant-specific database schema for data operations
3. WHEN multiple tenants use the service simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain complete data isolation between tenants
4. IF a tenant's settings are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the tenant's cache without affecting other tenants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want to send messages through various channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Signal, Web), so that I can interact with the chatbot using my preferred communication platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is received from any supported channel THEN the system SHALL accept it via the endpoint `/messages/receive/tenants/:tenantCode/channels/:channel/tokens/:token`
2. WHEN sending a message to any channel THEN the system SHALL use the endpoint `/messages/send/tenants/:tenantCode/channels/:channel/tokens/:token`
3. WHEN a channel-specific message is received THEN the system SHALL convert it to a common internal format
4. WHEN sending a response THEN the system SHALL convert the common format back to channel-specific format
5. WHEN a webhook receives a message THEN the system SHALL queue it in an in-memory async queue for processing rather than processing it directly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want to send different types of content (text, images, audio, video, buttons, lists, location), so that I can communicate effectively with the chatbot using rich media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a text message THEN the system SHALL process it as a text message type
2. WHEN a user sends an image THEN the system SHALL process it as an image message type and extract text if needed
3. WHEN a user sends audio THEN the system SHALL process it as an audio message type and convert to text
4. WHEN a user sends video THEN the system SHALL process it as a video message type and extract text/audio
5. WHEN a user interacts with multi-option buttons THEN the system SHALL process the selection as button interaction
6. WHEN a user selects from lists THEN the system SHALL process the selection as list interaction
7. WHEN a user sends location THEN the system SHALL process it as location message type
8. WHEN a user sends feedback emojis THEN the system SHALL process them as feedback message type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want my messages to be automatically translated and transcribed, so that I can communicate in my preferred language and the bot can understand various input formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is in a non-processable language THEN the system SHALL translate it to the processable format
2. WHEN an audio message is received THEN the system SHALL transcribe it to text
3. WHEN a video message is received THEN the system SHALL extract and transcribe audio to text
4. WHEN an image with text is received THEN the system SHALL extract text from the image
5. WHEN a button is clicked THEN the system SHALL convert the button action to corresponding option text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want my messages to be intelligently routed to appropriate handlers, so that I receive relevant and contextual responses based on my conversation state and intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is received THEN the system SHALL route it through the message routing module
2. WHEN routing a message THEN the system SHALL consider current conversation context and history
3. WHEN routing a message THEN the system SHALL identify the incoming message intent
4. WHEN routing a message THEN the system SHALL consider the current conversation mode (workflow, assessment, etc.)
5. WHEN in a specific conversation mode THEN the system SHALL maintain that mode until completion or explicit mode switch
6. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL return to the previous mode after completing the new mode
7. IF no specific handler matches THEN the system SHALL route to the fallback handler

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want the system to maintain conversation context, so that the bot can provide coherent and contextually relevant responses throughout our interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL create and maintain conversation context
2. WHEN processing a message THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant conversation history from the context provider
3. WHEN providing context to handlers THEN the system SHALL include user information and settings
4. WHEN context becomes large THEN the system SHALL summarize it as per configured options
5. WHEN context is needed by LLM service THEN the system SHALL provide it through the GenAIService interface

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want the system to recognize my intents and extract relevant entities, so that the bot can understand what I'm trying to accomplish and gather necessary information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is processed THEN the system SHALL attempt to identify user intent using NLP
2. WHEN an intent is identified THEN the system SHALL score it against registered intents for the tenant
3. WHEN multiple intents are possible THEN the system SHALL select the highest scoring intent
4. WHEN an intent requires entities THEN the system SHALL extract them from the message
5. WHEN entities are missing THEN the system SHALL ask follow-up questions to gather required information
6. WHEN intent is identified THEN the system SHALL trigger registered intent listeners asynchronously but await responses synchronously

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a bot user, I want to ask questions and get answers from the knowledge base, so that I can quickly find information relevant to my queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL route it to the RAG handler if appropriate
2. WHEN processing a RAG query THEN the system SHALL interact with the GenAIService interface
3. WHEN a knowledge base query is made THEN the system SHALL return relevant information from the RAG system
4. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL provide an appropriate fallback response
